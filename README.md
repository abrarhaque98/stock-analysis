# Stock-Analysis

### Project Overview

The goal was to give the end user the ability to see certain analysis done so by using macro's to analyze the data and embedding macro buttons for the end user to input a select year and clear the sheet. After doing so the code was reformatted to make the macro's analyze the data quicker and allowing the macro to be quicker on a larger scale.
