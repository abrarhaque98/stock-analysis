# Stock-Analysis

### Project Overview

The objective of this project was to analyze stock data using VBA macros in microsoft excel. The stock data contained data for two different years 2017 and 2018 for 12 different energy related stock tickers. The goal was to give the end user the ability to see certain analysis done so by using macro's to analyze the data and embedding macro buttons for the end user to input a select year and clear the sheet. After doing so the code was reformatted to make the macro's analyze the data quicker and allowing the macro to be quicker on a larger scale.

### Results 

**Stock Analysis Results**

With the running of the macro's for the years 2017 and 2018 the following stock analysis results were yielded.

From the images above we are able to tell that in 2017 most stocks had a positive return and were in the green with the exception of TERP being down 7.2%.
For 2018 we see that most stocks were down except for ENPH and RUN with those two being positive atleast 8x% and positive the year before.

**Code Refactor Time Difference**

The following pictures show the time difference for the macro's to execute for each year.
