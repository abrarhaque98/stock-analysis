# Stock-Analysis

### Project Overview

The objective of this project was to analyze stock data using VBA macros in microsoft excel. The stock data contained data for two different years 2017 and 2018 for 12 different tickers. The goal was to give the end user the ability to see certain analysis done so by using macro's to analyze the data and embedding macro buttons for the end user to input a select year and clear the sheet. After doing so the code was reformatted to make the macro's analyze the data quicker and allowing the macro to be quicker on a larger scale.
